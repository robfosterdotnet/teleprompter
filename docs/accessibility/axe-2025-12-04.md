# Axe Accessibility Audit — 2025-12-04

- **Command:** `npx @axe-core/cli http://127.0.0.1:4173 --exit`
- **Target:** Vite dev server (`npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
- **axe-core version:** 4.11.0 (Chrome headless)
- **Result:** 0 violations detected across the teleprompter main view.

Notes:

- The audit ran against the default dark theme with presenter controls visible.
- Manual keyboard testing plus existing `vitest-axe` + Playwright `@axe-core/playwright` checks remain in place to catch regressions during development and CI.
- Remember: automated tooling covers roughly 20–50% of WCAG issues; continue spot-checking headings, focus order, and live-region announcements as new widgets ship.
