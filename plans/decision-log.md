# Decision Log

Running list of notable engineering decisions for the teleprompter project. Add new entries (latest first) so contributors understand the context behind our direction.

| Date       | Decision                                                                                                       | Context                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2025-12-03 | Drive theming via CSS custom properties + body classes instead of Tailwind theme switching.                    | Needed immediate support for dark/light/high-contrast palettes while keeping the presenter shell framework-agnostic; CSS vars let us mirror the same tokens inside future native shells. |
| 2025-12-03 | Store import/export format as Markdown headings + JSON snapshots.                                              | Markdown keeps rundowns human-editable while JSON preserves full fidelity for automation; both feed through shared normalization helpers.                                                |
| 2025-12-03 | Adopt Zustand for global script + playback state with lightweight persistence hooks.                           | Task 3 requires quick iteration on playback controls without verbose boilerplate; Zustand keeps actions simple and plays nicely with React hooks until we need something heavier.        |
| 2025-12-03 | Adopt ESLint (flat, type-aware) + Prettier + Tailwind linting, enforced via Husky & CI.                        | Task 2 emphasized catching regressions early; the new toolchain keeps code style/quality consistent locally and in GitHub Actions.                                                       |
| 2025-12-03 | Standardize on Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom for unit/UI tests.                                             | Needed a fast test runner compatible with Vite; aligns with React ecosystem and supports future E2E hooks.                                                                               |
| 2025-12-03 | Configure Tailwind + PostCSS now even though styles are handcrafted.                                           | Prepping theme tokens early makes it easier to migrate components and keep design tokens centralized.                                                                                    |
| 2025-12-03 | Build as a web-only React + TypeScript app scaffolded with Vite.                                               | Requirement confirmed that a browser-based teleprompter suffices; Vite offers fast DX and works well for a PWA path.                                                                     |
| 2025-12-03 | Maintain planning artifacts (`plans/teleprompter-plan.md`, `plans/progress-tracker.md`) under version control. | Keeps roadmap decisions transparent for junior devs and supports async reviews.                                                                                                          |
